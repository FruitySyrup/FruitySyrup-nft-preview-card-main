# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). 
This is my first challenge I've done since moving out of the SuperHi lessons and their sandbox.

*Note that I did not have the figma/sketch file to get exact pixels, colors or styles. I did make deviations from the style-guide.md when they did not match the final design.

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

This project was the first time I worked in VSC. It introduced me to the basic HTML template, how to use *, :root and ways to style li/ul elements.  


### Useful resources
